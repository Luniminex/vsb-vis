# Vision: Online Card Pack Opening and Collection Management Information System

## Why
The main reason for developing this new Information System (IS) is to provide card collectors
with a digital platform where they can open virtual card packs and manage their collections.
Currently, collectors often rely on physical card packs and manual methods for tracking their collections.
This platform will offer an engaging, centralized, and accessible way for users to enjoy
opening packs, organize their collections, and participate in trading.

## What
The system will enable users to:

- Open virtual card packs with random contents.
- Manage and track their card collections digitally.
- Trade cards with other users in real-time.
- Purchase card packs or individual cards through a virtual marketplace using in-game currency.
- Earn rewards and achievements for their collecting and trading activities.

## Who
The key roles that will use this system include:

- Admin: Oversees the platform, manages users, updates the card database, and monitors system performance.
- User/Collector: Engages in pack opening, manages their collection, and trades cards with other users.
- Trader: Specialized users who focus on trading cards, with additional features for managing their trades.
- Marketplace Manager (Optional): Could be responsible for managing the availability of special packs or promotions in the marketplace.

## Where
The system will be a web-based application accessible globally. It will be cloud-hosted to ensure scalability and worldwide access.
The platform will be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices through a responsive web interface, with a potential future native mobile app.

## When
The system will be in use:

- When users want to open card packs and add new items to their collections.
- When users want to view, organize, or trade cards in their collection.
- During marketplace transactions, either for buying card packs or individual cards.
- When users wish to view or complete achievements and earn rewards.

## How

The system will be developed using an agile methodology. This will allow for regular iterations, responding to user feedback,
and adding new features incrementally. Continuous deployment of new updates will help improve user experience and introduce
new content, such as card expansions or marketplace features.
